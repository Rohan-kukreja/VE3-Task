CSV Data Analysis and Visualization Project

1) Project Description
This project is a web application built using Django that allows users to upload CSV files for data analysis and visualization. Once a CSV file is uploaded, the application performs various statistical analyses and generates visualizations to provide comprehensive insights into the data. The main features include displaying data summaries, detecting missing values, computing correlation matrices, and creating several types of plots such as histograms, pair plots, and heatmaps.

2) Features
CSV File Upload: Users can upload CSV files through a simple web interface.
Data Analysis:
Display the first few rows of the data (data head).
Compute and display summary statistics.
Count and display missing values.
Compute and display the correlation matrix.

3) Data Visualization:
Generate histograms for numerical columns.
Create pair plots to show relationships between numerical variables.
Produce a correlation heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical features.

4) Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for backend development.
Django: The web framework used to build and manage the web application.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library used to handle the CSV data.
Matplotlib: A plotting library used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, used for making attractive and informative statistical graphics.
